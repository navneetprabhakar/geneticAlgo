# Genetic Algorithm example using JAVA
This repository is implementation of Genetic Algorithm to solve the "Evolution of a salesman" problem.
Lets say there is a travelling salesman who has to visit different cities daily. He starts from one of the cities and has to travel to each city once and return to the origin city. We have to calculate the shortest route using Genetic algorithm.

# Introduction:
Genetic Algorithm is an algorithm that is inspired from the process of "Natural Selection".
